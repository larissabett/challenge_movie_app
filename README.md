# 🎬📽🎞 Movie Challenge app 

Challenge developed in flutter, using clean architecture, based on data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.


## 📱 Project information

📍 This project uses the TMDB API to display a screen with details of a movie, based on its id.</br>
📍 Details are: title, number of likes and popularity.

📍 Based on this id, a list of similar movies is presented, containing information about the title, year of release and genre.

💡 Note. I will continue to complement this project, as a source of studies. Unfortunately, there was no time to properly configure the return of the genre, but I will continue to work on it and update the functionality soon.

♥ Regardless of the outcome of the process, I am grateful for the opportunity of the challenge.
